## Map viewer for Atom

#### an Atom package for visualizing and editing [map.json](https://github.com/gherardovarando/map.schema.json) files.

##### it uses [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and [leaflet-map-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet-map-builder).

### How to use

- Open a valid map.json file and lunch the viewer with **Packages -> Map Viewer -> Open** or with `ctrl-alt-m`.

- Create an empty map.json with **Packages -> Map Viewer -> New -> Map** and manually add layers.

- The map will be updated every time the file is saved.

- Switch on/off layer control in package setting.

#### Adding layers

Some layer templates can be loaded from the context menu (right-click) on the editor or via keybindings: `ctrl-alt-n` followed by `m` (marker), `p` (polygon), `l` (polyline), `t` (tile layer), `g` (GeoJSON).

Similarly, you can activate drawing capabilities via `ctrl-alt-v` followed by `p` (polygon), `l` (polyline), .... Once drawing is done the skeleton of the layer configuration is available in the clipboard, just paste the text in the configuration file and save it to reload the map.

#### Minimal example

Copy paste the following map.json in your editor and lunch the map-viewer (e.g. with `ctrl-alt-m`).

```
